# hascheevos
An index of game IDs that has cheevos.

---

This is about [RetroAchievements](http://retroachievements.org).

The files in this repository have a quite straightforward structure:

```
game_id:has_cheevos
```

Where `gameid` is an positive integer, and `has_cheevos` is `true` or `false`. Example for **Sonic the Hedgehog (Mega Drive)**:

```
1:true
```
